# Linux & DevOps Foundations (Day 1 – Day 5)
## Personal Study Notes with Command Explanations

---

## Introduction

This document captures my understanding of the tasks completed during **Days 1–5** of the *100 Days of DevOps Practice Challenge (KodeKloud)*.

The goal of these notes is to clearly explain:
- What each task required
- Why it was necessary in a real-world environment
- What each command does, line by line

This is written as **personal documentation** for revision, clarity, and long-term reference.

## Day 1 – Creating a Non-Interactive User

### What I did
I created a user named `alice` with a **non-interactive shell**, meaning the user cannot log in via SSH or terminal.

### Why this matters
Not every user account on a Linux system is meant for human login. Some accounts exist purely for services or automation tools (such as backup agents). Allowing such users to log in interactively would be unnecessary and insecure.

### Command used
```bash
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin alice
````

### Command explanation

* `sudo` allows the command to run with administrative privileges.
* `useradd` creates a new user account.
* `-s /sbin/nologin` assigns a shell that blocks interactive login.
* `yousuf` is the username being created.

### Verification

```bash
getent passwd yousuf
```

This confirms that the user exists and that the assigned shell is `/sbin/nologin`.

### Key takeaway

Service or automation users should always have **restricted access**.

## Day 2 – Creating a Temporary User with an Expiry Date

### What I did

I created a user named `javed` with an account expiry date set to **2024-04-15**.

### Why this matters

In real environments, access is often temporary (contractors, short-term projects). Setting an expiry date ensures access is automatically revoked without relying on manual cleanup.

### Command used

```bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-04-15 javed
```

### Command explanation

* `sudo` provides the required privileges.
* `useradd` creates the user.
* `-e 2024-04-15` sets the account expiration date.
* `javed` is the username (lowercase as required).

### Verification

```bash
sudo chage -l javed
```

This displays account aging information, including the expiry date.

### Key takeaway

Access should always have a **defined lifecycle**.

## Day 3 – Disabling Direct Root SSH Login

### What I did

I disabled direct SSH login for the `root` user on all application servers.

### Why this matters

The `root` account has unrestricted privileges and is a primary target for attackers. Allowing direct root SSH access reduces accountability and increases security risk. A safer approach is to log in as a regular user and elevate privileges using `sudo`.

### Command used

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^#\?PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Command explanation

* `sudo` is required to modify system configuration files.
* `sed` is a stream editor used for automated text replacement.
* `-i` edits the file in place.
* The search-and-replace expression ensures `PermitRootLogin` is set to `no`, whether it was commented or not.
* `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is the SSH daemon configuration file.

### Apply the change

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Restarting the SSH service is required for the configuration change to take effect.

### Verification

```bash
sudo grep -i PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

This confirms that root SSH login has been disabled.

### Key takeaway

Root access should be **controlled and indirect**, never exposed directly.

## Day 4 – Granting Executable Permissions to a Script

### What I did

I granted executable permissions to a bash script so that all users could execute it.

### Why this matters

Linux does not allow scripts to run unless they are explicitly marked as executable. Automation scripts (backups, cron jobs, CI/CD tasks) will fail if permissions are not set correctly.

### Command used

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

### Command explanation

* `sudo` allows modification of file permissions.
* `chmod` changes file permissions.
* `755` means:

  * Owner: read, write, execute
  * Group: read, execute
  * Others: read, execute
* `/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh` is the script being updated.

### Verification

```bash
ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

This confirms that the execute (`x`) permission is set for all users.

### Key takeaway

Correct file permissions are essential for reliable automation.

## Day 5 – Installing and Permanently Disabling SELinux

### What I did

I installed the required SELinux packages and permanently disabled SELinux by modifying its configuration file, without rebooting the server.

### Why this matters

SELinux is powerful but can interfere with applications if not properly configured. In many environments, it is temporarily disabled during setup or testing, then re-enabled later with the correct policies.

### Install required packages

```bash
sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils
```

### Command explanation

* `yum` is the package manager for RHEL-based systems.
* `install` installs software packages.
* `-y` automatically confirms prompts.
* The listed packages are required for SELinux functionality.

### Permanently disable SELinux

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config
```

This ensures SELinux will be disabled after the next reboot.

### Verification

```bash
cat /etc/selinux/config
```

The presence of `SELINUX=disabled` confirms the permanent setting.

### Important note

The command:

```bash
getenforce
```

may still show `Enforcing` or `Permissive`. This is expected because the system was not rebooted.

### Key takeaway

Permanent system behavior is controlled by **configuration files**, not runtime commands.

## Final Reflections (Days 1–5)

Through these tasks, I strengthened my understanding of:

* Linux user and access management
* Security hardening practices
* File permission control
* The difference between runtime and persistent configuration

These fundamentals form the base for more advanced DevOps topics such as automation, CI/CD, containers, and cloud infrastructure.
