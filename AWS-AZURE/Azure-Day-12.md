# Day 12 – Azure Learning Journey

## Objective
The objective of Day 12 was to apply proper tagging to an existing Azure Virtual Machine. This task focused on resource organization and management by adding metadata to identify the environment of the VM.

---

## Azure Services / Concepts Covered
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Resource tagging
- Key–value metadata
- Resource organization and governance
- Portal-based resource management

---

## Steps I Took

1. Logged into the Azure Portal using the provided credentials.
2. Navigated to **Virtual machines** via the Azure search bar.
3. Selected the virtual machine named **devops-vm**.
4. Opened the **Tags** section from the VM’s settings menu.
5. Added a new tag with the key **Environment** and the value **dev**.
6. Saved the changes to apply the tag.
7. Verified that the tag **Environment=dev** was successfully added to the VM.

## Key Takeaways

- Tags help organize and manage Azure resources effectively.
- Key–value pairs can be used to identify environments, owners, or purposes.
- Proper tagging supports cost tracking and governance.
- Tags can be added or modified without stopping the VM.
- Consistent tagging is important in large or growing cloud environments.
