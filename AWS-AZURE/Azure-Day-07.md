# Day 7 – Azure Learning Journey

## Objective
The objective of Day 7 was to allocate a Public IP address in Azure. This task focused on creating a standalone networking resource that can later be associated with other Azure services such as virtual machines or load balancers.

---

## Azure Services / Concepts Covered
- Azure Public IP addresses
- Static vs dynamic IP assignment
- Azure networking resources
- Portal-based resource provisioning
- Resource groups

---

## Steps I Took

1. Logged into the Azure Portal using the provided credentials.
2. Used the Azure search bar to navigate to **Public IP addresses**.
3. Clicked on **Create** to allocate a new Public IP.
4. Selected the existing resource group.
5. Set the Public IP name to **datacenter-pip**.
6. Chose **IPv4** as the IP version.
7. Set the IP assignment method to **Static**.
8. Left the SKU as the default option.
9. Reviewed the configuration and created the Public IP address.
10. Verified that the Public IP was successfully created and assigned an IP address.

## Issues Faced
- No issues were encountered while allocating the Public IP address.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Public IP addresses provide external connectivity to Azure resources.
- Static IP assignment ensures the IP address does not change.
- Public IPs can be created independently and attached later.
- Proper naming helps with resource identification and management.
- Azure Portal simplifies networking resource creation.

## Conclusion
Day 7 focused on allocating a Public IP address as part of Azure’s networking setup. This task reinforced the importance of separating networking resources from compute resources and prepared the environment for future resource associations during the migration process.
