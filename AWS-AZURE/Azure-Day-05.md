# Day 5 – Azure Learning Journey

## Objective
The objective of Day 5 was to create a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure with a specific IPv4 CIDR block. This task focused on defining a precise network address range to support future services and workloads during the migration process.

## Azure Services / Concepts Covered
- Azure Virtual Networks (VNet)
- IPv4 CIDR addressing
- Azure regions
- Portal-based networking configuration
- Network planning and segmentation

## Steps I Took

1. Logged into the Azure Portal using the provided credentials.
2. Navigated to **Virtual networks** using the Azure search bar.
3. Clicked on **Create** to start creating a new Virtual Network.
4. Selected the existing resource group.
5. Set the Virtual Network name to **datacenter-vnet**.
6. Chose **East US** as the deployment region.
7. Configured the IPv4 address space as **192.168.0.0/24**.
8. Left the default subnet configuration unchanged.
9. Reviewed the configuration and created the Virtual Network.
10. Verified that the Virtual Network was successfully created.

## Key Takeaways

- Virtual Networks form the backbone of Azure networking.
- CIDR blocks define the usable IP address range within a VNet.
- Proper IP planning is essential when creating multiple VNets.
- Azure Portal simplifies network creation with guided steps.
- Region selection is critical for resource locality and performance.
