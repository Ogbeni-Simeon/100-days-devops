# Day 17 – AWS Learning Journey

## Objective
The objective of Day 17 was to create an IAM group in AWS. This task focused on understanding how groups are used in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to simplify and organize permission management.

---

## AWS Services / Concepts Covered
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- IAM Groups
- User and group-based access control
- Global AWS services

---

## Steps I Took

1. Logged into the AWS Management Console using the provided credentials.
2. Navigated to **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** from the AWS services menu.
3. Opened the **User groups** section in the IAM dashboard.
4. Clicked **Create group**.
5. Entered the group name **iamgroup_jim**.
6. Created the group without attaching any policies or permissions.
7. Verified that the group **iamgroup_jim** appeared in the list of IAM groups.

## Issues Faced
- No issues were encountered while creating the IAM group.

## Key Takeaways

- IAM groups are used to manage permissions for multiple users at once.
- Permissions are assigned to groups using policies, not directly to users.
- Users inherit permissions from the groups they belong to.
- IAM is a global AWS service, independent of AWS regions.
- Creating groups first helps maintain organized and scalable access control.

## Conclusion
Day 17 focused on creating an IAM group, reinforcing best practices for managing access in AWS. This task demonstrated how groups serve as a foundation for scalable and maintainable permission management as infrastructure and teams grow.
