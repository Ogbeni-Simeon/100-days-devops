# Day 4 – Azure Learning Journey

## Objective
The objective of Day 4 was to create a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure using the Azure Portal. This task focused on setting up foundational networking components required for hosting cloud resources.

---

## Azure Services / Concepts Covered
- Azure Virtual Networks (VNet)
- Azure regions
- IPv4 CIDR addressing
- Portal-based resource creation
- Resource groups

---

## Steps I Took

1. Logged into the Azure Portal using the provided credentials.
2. Used the Azure search bar to navigate to **Virtual networks**.
3. Clicked on **Create** to start creating a new VNet.
4. Selected the existing resource group.
5. Entered the VNet name as **nautilus-vnet**.
6. Selected **East US** as the region.
7. Configured the IPv4 address space using a valid CIDR block.
8. Left the default subnet configuration unchanged.
9. Reviewed the configuration and created the Virtual Network.
10. Verified that the deployment completed successfully.

## Key Takeaways

- Virtual Networks are the foundation of networking in Azure.
- VNets must be created in a specific Azure region.
- CIDR blocks define the IP address range available within a VNet.
- Azure Portal provides a simple and guided way to create networking resources.
- Networking components are essential before deploying compute resources.
