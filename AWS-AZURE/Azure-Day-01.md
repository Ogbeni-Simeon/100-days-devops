# Day 1 – Azure Learning Journey

## Objective
The objective of Day 1 was to begin the Azure learning journey by creating an SSH key pair. This task introduced how Azure manages secure access to Linux virtual machines using SSH keys.

---

## Azure Services / Concepts Covered
- Azure SSH Keys
- Public and private key authentication
- Resource groups
- Secure access to Azure Virtual Machines

---

## Steps I Took

1. Logged into the Azure Portal using the provided temporary credentials.
2. Used the Azure search bar to navigate to the **SSH keys** service.
3. Clicked on **Create** to generate a new SSH key pair.
4. Selected the appropriate subscription and resource group.
5. Entered the SSH key name as **nautilus-kp**.
6. Chose to **generate a new key pair** instead of uploading an existing one.
7. Selected **RSA** as the key type.
8. Reviewed the configuration and created the SSH key.
9. Downloaded and securely saved the private key file.
10. Verified that the SSH key was successfully created and listed in the portal.

## Issues Faced
- No issues were encountered during the creation of the SSH key pair.

---

## Key Takeaways

- SSH keys are the preferred and secure way to access Linux VMs in Azure.
- Azure allows SSH keys to be managed as standalone resources.
- Private keys must be downloaded and stored securely because they cannot be retrieved again.
- RSA is a commonly used and secure key type for SSH authentication.
- Foundational security resources should be created before deploying compute resources.

## Conclusion
Day 1 focused on establishing secure access in Azure by creating an SSH key pair. This task marks the first practical step in the Azure cloud journey and lays the groundwork for deploying and managing Linux virtual machines securely in future tasks.

You’re now running **AWS + Azure side by side** — that’s a strong multi-cloud DevOps path ☁️💪
